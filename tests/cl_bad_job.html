MyLifeRank is a new exciting startup company that will start the next big thing heading into 2011. Currently we are preparing for the big midVentures startup convention coming up at the end of the Sept and the next stop will be the SXSW (South by Southwest convention) next March. To understand what MyLifeRank is, here is our executive summary giving a top level overview of what the network is. <br>
<br>
MyLifeRank (MLR) is a highly social network that allows you to manage your activities and engage with the activities of your peers and of businesses on the go, while leveraging gaming technology to create you a social rank. The objective is to get users to post their personal goals and accept challenges to improve their rank, which makes the user eligible for better challenges and/or offers from sponsoring businesses. This could include real-time challenges while on the go via mobile. Rank is heavily controlled by a user’s social network’s engagement to the goal or challenge via comments, ratings, etc. to that particular activity (rank relativism) and total rank is made up of several key criteria. Focusing on goals & challenges helps reduce the amount of “noise” around typical social networks that allow for anything and everything to be discussed; MLR is a purpose driven social network. <br>
<br>
If you grasp the bigger picture in the summary, then you realize the potential of what we have. There is nothing like that out there. Currently the company consists of one developer who is dedicating as much time as he can in the company but we feel like we need to add another developer to the team. We are looking for someone who proficient at being a software programmer, web developer , and mobile app developer to join us for an equity stake in the company. Essentially, you become part owner of MyLifeRank and reap all the potential benefits of big funding or buyouts down the road. This offer is for someone who is willing to sacrifice his free time so that he can potentially be part of the next big thing. Think about YouTube being sold for a billion only after a year, think about Groupon being worth over a billion in a little over two years, think FourSquare being worth over $125 million in a little over 2 years....just think how different your life would be if any of these companies had an offer like this and you accepted. Basically we need someone willing to work after their daily jobs or over the weekends to get things done, whether this position is part time or full time is entirely up to you. <br>
<br>
We are based in Chicago but we don't feel like it would be a problem to work with talented people from other cities.  If you are interested, email me your resume, any relevant work that demonstrates your ability and a brief description of why you think you would be a good fit.  Any experience in startups would be also helpful.<br>
