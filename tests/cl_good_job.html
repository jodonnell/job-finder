We're looking for brilliant Rails developers to join our star team in San Francisco, New York, and Boulder offices. If you want to share your knowledge while learning from others, work sustainably, and work on some serious projects, we think you'll have a blast working with us.
<br>

<br>

<br>
    * Test and Behaviour Driven Development
<br>
    * Pair Programming

<br>
    * Experience with testing frameworks, from RSpec to Cucumber and Jasmine

Why join us?
<br>

<br>
   1. We're agile. That means test-driven development with tools like RSpec, Test::Unit, JUnit, JsUnit, Jasmine, Cucumber, and Selenium. It means pair-programming, refactoring, and state-of-the-art continuous integration, build, and deployment infrastructure.
<br>
   2. We've got a real culture. We share it by rotating developers between projects. With us, you may work on five, six, or even more projects in a single year.
<br>
   3. We're good, and always improving. We have daily stand-up meetings and regular retrospectives. We figure out what we're doing wrong, so we can fix it, and what we're doing right, so we can make it even better. Working here means you get better at what you already do well, every day. 
<br>

<br>
We've got multiple teams of Rails and Java developers working on a variety of products at our labs in downtown San Francisco, New York City, and Boulder, and at some very well known companies around the Bay Area and beyond.
